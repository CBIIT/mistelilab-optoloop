# mistelilab-optoloop

### General Information

This is a repo containing the R code used to generate the results included in a bioRxiv preprint from the Misteli Lab at the National Cancer Institute/NIH. The manuscript introduces a new experimental tool, called OptoLoop, which can be used to manipulate 3D genome structure in live cells in a rapid fashion.

**Title:** OptoLoop: An optogenic tool to probe the functional role of genome organization.

**Authors:** Martin Stortz, Adib Keikhosravi, Gianluca Pegoraro, Tom Misteli.

**DOI:** TBD
